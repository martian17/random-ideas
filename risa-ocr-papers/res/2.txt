Adverse Selection in Health Insurance

Health insurance might startle an “adverse selection death spiral’. The sick are more likely to want
health insurance than the healthy. However, if too many sick people versus healthy people buy
insurances, then the company has to raise its rates. In turn, the higher rates make health insurance
even more undesirable for healthy individuals, thus pushing them out of the market. Some market
features help limit this adverse selection problem:

e@ Inspections or checkups. An insurance company can adjust rates based on periodic health

checkups of its customers.

e Group plans. An insurance company can emphasize sales to groups, such as through someone's

workplace, to increase the chances of signing up both healthy and unhealthy customers.

e Conscientiousness. Some individuals value health insurance more than others, independently
from their health status. Insurance companies will target individuals who value and are careful
heir health. This will lead not to adverse selection, but to positive selection which moderates
he adverse selection death spiral.
