Experiments
eset mee oa to test the theory. In all experiments participants were allocated to be
either ‘poor or ‘rich’, with ‘poor’ having smaller budgets and different borrowing conditions.

Experiment 1 and 2 show how scarcity creates focus. Experiments 2 to 5 how scarcity makes people
borrow more.

Experiment 1: 60 participants played Wheel of Fortune. Budgeting was different in terms of chances
to guess letters in a word puzzle, where ‘rich’ had more guesses than ‘poor’. In this experiments poor
performed worse. Scarcity increased the engagement in the problem, which made poor more fatigued
(tired) and depleted.

Experiment 2: Shows how scarcity changes engagement. Participants played ‘Angry Birds’ with
different budgets in terms of number of shots. Poor were aging more engaged which led to higher
performance per shot. Hence, if scarcity can engage us too much, abundance might engage us too
little. Moreover, poor participants borrowed more which was counterproductive, hence, suggesting
that poor overborrowed. So, scarcity’ focusing effects: The more focused the poor were on the current
round, the more they neglected (and borrowed away from) future rounds.
