undermine "the moral sentiments": Evidence from economic experiments,
Science, 320, 1605-1609. :
This article stresses the idea that incentives that appeal to self-interest may fail when they undermine

the moral values that lead people to act altruistically or out of ethical drive. The author presents some
behavioral experiments that support his theory.

Introduction

David Hume, philosopher, and economist claimed that constitutions and public policies should be
designed for “knaves” motivated only by their “private interest”. He believed that people were selfish,
making choices out of egoism without knowing what is actually good for them. In this case, policies’
designed to align self-interest wi th the social interest may be counterproductive. E.g., One behavioral
y fona daycare center that introduced a fine when children were picked up late. The idea
was that many parents do not want a fine, so they would pick up their children earlier. Instead, the

number of late pick-ups increased dramatically. The ethical commitment disappeared, and parents
saw the pick-up as something that was up for sale.

Incentives and Market Failures

Market failures arise when individuals do not take into account the effects of their actions on others
(external effects or spillovers). Complete contracts eliminate the spillovers, internalizing the external
effects of an action, so that self-interested individuals implement outcomes that are socially efficient.
However, contracts are rarely complete, mainly because of asymmetric information and the
impossibility of writing an enforceable contract (e.g., a contract between labor markets and credit
markets that specifies that the employee will work hard and well).
