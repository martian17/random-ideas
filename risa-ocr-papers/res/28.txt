(b) Selection among Academic Journals

Controlled Trials (RCTs) using behavioral
interventions to improve government services,
They prioritize good trial design, research
transparency, and documentation of protocols,
The two units have shared goals: to use behavioral
science to improve the delivery of government
services through rigorous RCTs, and to build the
capacity of government agencies to use RCTs.
Final sample consists of 126 randomized trials
that include 241 nudges and involve 23.5 million
participants (see. Figure)

Trials in Academic Journals

In a recent meta-analysis, Hummel and Maedche
(2019) selected 100 papers screened out of over
2000 initial papers identified as having “nudge” or
“nudging” in the title, abstract, or keyword. A
second meta-analysis that covers several areas is
Benartzi et al. (2017), which does a cost-benefit
comparison of a few behavioral interventions to
traditional incentive-based interventions. We
thus combine the behavioral trials in Hummel and

Maedche (2019) and in Benartzi et al. (2017), for
a total of 102 trials (see figure).
