effects on the nature of the choices that are available to people. The intro uC oe i bed markets
can change environments, individual preferences, capacities, and values. Even in the case of a fair trade
and an uncoerced choice, as Ronald Dworkin argues, body parts should not be part of our social
resources at all.

The objection is based on the idea that people should not have to pay a cost for refusing to sell their
body parts. A person’s relationship to their body is so important that Jt should enjoy a special
Protection against the effects of market forces. Nevertheless, especially ne the third world,
governments have been struggling with a thriving black market. If the poor are as likely to participate
in a black market for kidneys as in a legal market, then banning the exchange does not seem a good
way of honoring their autonomy.

C. Objectionable Inequality and Asymmetric Vulnerability

A kidney market would almost certainly entail that poor people would disproportionately be the organ
sellers of the world, while rich people the recipients. By contrast, a procurement system that relies on
donations is much more likely to have suppliers that come from all classes of people. Some critics raise
the legitimate concern that the introduction of kidney markets will actually worsen existing inequality.
A kidney market would seem to mean that kidneys go to the highest bidders.

But should kidneys not be allocated to people on the basis of need, length of time waiting, and medical
suital , and not on the basis of ability to pay? Theoretically, however, governments might engage
in ition of such markets, in order to Provide funding for the Poor, or even create a monopoly
