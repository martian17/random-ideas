/ What is wrong about the nature of some markets? How should our social policies respond to
undesirable trades? When and why should we seek to regulate or block a market?
The author begins by stating two basic assumptions of her account:

e First, she aims to discuss some specific markets that she classifies as “noxious” — immoral and
toxic to individuals and/or society as a whole. E.g., trade in human body parts, child labor, toxic
waste, sex, and life-saving medicines.

e Second, she is not taking in consideration cases of extreme scarcity, where “tragic choices” are
to be made. The author argues that the problem of noxious markets is related to the standing
of the parties involved in the trade. In short, noxious markets undermine the conditions for
equality within society.

The approach to markets she defends recognizes market heterogeneity and considers other values
besides efficiency and distributional equality narrowly conceived.
