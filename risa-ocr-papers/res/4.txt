i Endogenous Preferences

Preferences are endogenous if one’s experiences result in durable changes in motivations, and
therefore a change in behavior in given situations. Incentives may change preferences because they
affect key aspects of how we acquire our motivations. An experiment found that in anonymous
experimental settings, individuals from the more market-integrated societies were also more fair-
minded, in that they made more generous offers to their experimental partners and more often chose
to receive nothing rather than accept an unfair offer. This kind of fair-mindedness is essential to the
exchange process in market-oriented societies, where individuals engaging in mutually beneficial
-exchan with strangers represent models of successful behavior who are then copied by others.
