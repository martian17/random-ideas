Abstract ; ; '

The article is based on concern about developments of Al and societal expectations about its moral
decisions. The Moral Machine experiment aimed to address the challenge of determining societal

expectations for the ethical principles that should guide machine behavior, particularly in autonomous
vehicles.

Introduction

Today machines we are using are not only used to promote wellbeing but also distribute harm that
cannot be eliminated. Unavoidable harm scenario is a car crash scenario. Here autonomous (driverless)

vehicles would need to decide between different stakeholders on the road. Regardless, of how rare
these cases are, ethical principles should be established.

The challenge arises and cannot be solved by one party only. First challenge is high dimensionality of
the problem: thousands of combinations of preferences must be analyzed which challenges
conventional data collection methods. Secondly, to make universal ethical principles for Al we need to
understand local preferences, which again requires substantial sample size.

Hence, in respon \wad et al. (2018) designed the Moral
