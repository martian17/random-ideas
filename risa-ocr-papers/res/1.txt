Lecture 1 — Do Markets Shape Our Morals?

Cowen, T., & Tabarrok, A. (2015). Modern principles of economics, Chapter

24, Macmillan International Higher Education.

Markets work best when traders know exactly what is being traded. When this is the case, markets
will attract both buyers and sellers because each side expects trade to be mutually profitable.
Asymmetric information is defined as when one party in an exchange has more or better information

The principal-agent problem occurs when one party has different intentions than the other. How can
a principal (employer) incentivize an agent (employee) to work in the principal's interest even when
the agent has information that the principal does not?

Moral hazard is when an agent tries to exploit an information advantage in a dishonest or undesirable
way.
There are two solutions to asymmetric information and moral hazard problems:

1. Provide more information, thereby reducing the asymmetry.

2. Reduce the incentive for the knowledgeable party to exploit their information advantage.

Overcoming Moral Hazard by Providing More Information

The internet has played a big role in helping overcome asymmetric information by making it easier for
buyers to pool their knowledge. The internet has increased the value of having a good reputation.
Reviews have two advantages. They make it easier to avoid deceitful sellers and they raise the cost to
sellers of exploiting their information advantage. Nevertheless, consumer reviews can be easily faked
to make one’s own store look better, or a rival store look inferior. The general problem is that the more
inion ce becomes, the greater the incentive to fake that rating or niente it. Rating
