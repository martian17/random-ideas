Good policies and constitutions are those that support socially valued ends not only by harnessing

selfish preferences to public ends but also by evoking, cultivating, and empowering public-spirited
motives.

This article presents controlled experimental evidence on how market interaction changes how
individuals value harm and damage done to third parties.

The Mouse Paradigm â€˜
In the experiment, subjects had to decide between either saving the life of a mouse (and not receiving
money) or receiving money (and killing the mouse). Three different conditions were analyzed:

1. Individual treatment (one individual makes the decision).

2. Bilateral trading market (a buyer and a seller bargain to set prices).

3. Multilateral trading market (multiple buyers and sellers trade with each other).

In the individual treatment, subjects faced a simple binary choice. The subject could decide whether
to save the life of the mouse and receive nothing, or to kill the mouse and get 10 euros. In the bilateral
double auction market, one seller and one buyer bargained over killing a mouse for a total gain of 20
euros that the two parties could split up. The multilateral double auction market treatment was exactly
like the bilateral market treatment, except that in this condition there were several buyers and sellers.
The hypothesis of the authors was that markets would display a tendency to erode moral standards,
because of three e: features of market interaction: .
