Economy, 72:4, 417-435

The figure above illustrates vertical ethical pluralism. There are three main ethical frameworks, which
focus on different aspects of human behavior and choice:
1. Virtue ethics relate to the person’s character and virtue.
2. Duty ethics relate to the action itself and explore the rules and duties for action that could be
derived from God or rational thought.
3. Outcome ethics (utilitarian) relate to the evaluation of outcomes.

As the figure above shows, a virtuous economic agent will have the self-control to obey rules and
duties, and thereby obtain desirable outcomes. Nevertheless, such positive outcomes are not the
motive for virtuous behavior and the calculation of outcomes is not the adopted method of ethical
discernment. The upward dotted arrow Posits a positive feedback loop between outcomes and virtues,
which suggests that being part of a well-developed market makes people more inclined toward
Positive, other-regarding behaviors. Thus, trade can be defended on pluralist grounds of both good
outcomes and promotion of virtue ethics. In fact, moral sentiments about fairness and trust — rather
than simply a calculation of personal gain or loss — undergird many exchi ge relationships. Vertical
pluralism offers researchers the insight that multiple ethical fra rks are at work in market
Processes and public policies. : MARS teh 5
