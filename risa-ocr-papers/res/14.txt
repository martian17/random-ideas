The Moral Machine project was atypical in its objectives and ambitions: no Ree has alee!
attempted to measure moral preferences using a nine-dimensional experimental design in more than

200 countries.

Even the strongest preferences expressed through the Moral Machine showed substantial cultural
Variations, and our project builds on a long tradition of investigating cultural variations in ethical
judgments, however, they might not be fatal.

Video: Michael Sandel: Why We Shouldn’t Trust Markets with Our Civic Life
Michael Sandel discusses why we should not trust markets with our civic life. He asks the following
question: What should be the role of money and markets in our societies? Over the past three decades,
he argues, we have lived through a quiet revolution. We have drifted almost without realizing it from
having a market economy to becoming market societies. We can buy fast pass tickets to avoid lines in
theme parks and we can buy a cell upgrade in jail. Whereas a market economy is a valuable and
effective tool for organizing productive activity, a market society is a place where almost everything is
up for sale. Why should we worry?

1. Inequality issues. When money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the
good life, i.e., decent health care, access to the best education, political voice, and influence in
campaigns, inequality matters a great deal.

2. Unethical cash incentives. Market thinking and market values may change the meaning of some
social goods and practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about (e.g.,
incentivizing school through money results in taking away intrinsic motivation).

Economists often assume that markets are inert, that they do not touch or taint the goods they
__ exchange. Market exchange, they assume, does not change the meaning or value of the goods being
__ exchanged. This may be true enough if we are talking about material 800ds, but not for non-material

goods and social practices. In fact, in these cases, markets may undermine or crov d out relevant non-
arket values. They change the goods. Once we see that markets change the character of goods, we
